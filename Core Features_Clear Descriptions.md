# **Core Features — Clear Descriptions**

### **AI Health Monitoring & Risk Prediction**

Continuously converts daily vitals and past history into simple, explainable risk scores for common chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, heart disease). Displays trend visuals and short plain-language reasons behind each score.  
Value: Helps patients understand their health trajectory and helps clinicians proactively prioritize care.

### **Anomaly & Alert System**

Watches incoming vitals for sudden or dangerous changes and creates tiered alerts (mild → serious → urgent). Each alert includes a clear recommended next step (e.g., “Monitor for 24 hours” or “Contact your doctor now”).  
Value: Speeds response to potential emergencies and reduces preventable complications.

### **AI Prescription Analyzer**

Accepts uploaded prescriptions (English), extracts the medication details, and produces a patient-friendly summary that highlights doses, schedules, and immediate red flags (e.g., unusually high dose).  
Value: Reduces patient confusion about prescriptions and lowers routine clarification queries for clinicians.

### **Drug Combination Checker**

Evaluates a patient’s full medication list — including OTC drugs and supplements — against a drug-knowledge base to find interactions and cumulative risks. Returns severity levels and suggested monitoring or safer alternatives.  
Value: Prevents harmful drug interactions and minimizes medication-related side effects.

### **AI Health Assistant (Chatbot)**

A conversational assistant that answers patient questions in plain language (for example: “Is this drug safe with my BP medicine?” or “What does my risk score mean?”). Responses are contextualized with recent vitals and risk summaries.  
Value: Provides 24/7, on-demand guidance that educates patients and reduces non-urgent clinician workload.

### **Medication & Lifestyle Management**

Lets patients record and track medication adherence, exercise, sleep and other habits; sends reminders and shows progress streaks to motivate healthy behavior.  
Value: Improves adherence and links day-to-day behaviors to measurable health improvements.

### **Doctor’s Panel (Clinician Workspace)**

A consolidated clinician dashboard showing patient lists, triage filters (e.g., high-risk, new alerts), urgent flags, prescription warnings, and a unified patient history (vitals, prescriptions, alerts, lifestyle logs). Role-based access ensures appropriate viewing.  
Value: Saves clinician time, improves prioritization and coordination, and supports faster, safer decisions.

### **Patient Records Repository**

A single, unified record store for each patient holding vitals, prescription OCR and parsed data, computed risk scores, alerts, and lifestyle logs. Doctors can review, filter, and export records for clinical review.  
Value: Provides a reliable, complete history that supports continuity of care and informed decision-making.
